section: Independence
question: Will ${ association.name } be independant from any political affiliation or religious affiliation?
subquestion: |
  Does the association commit to be independent:
fields:
  - "from any political party": association.is_political
    datatype: yesnowide
  - "from any religion": association.is_religious 
    datatype: yesnowide
    
help: |
  * If you answer **yes**, remember to list your affiliations among your objectives on the section about **_Goals_**  
  * If you answer **no**, your association will not be able to pursue any goal that is politically or religiously oriented.  
  
  We advise you to think broadly about what considered political or religious.  
  
  For example, imagine your association aims at organizing classical music concerts. You start looking for venues and a local church accepts to host you for all rehearsals and concerts. This opens the door to interpretation and depending on the nature of your agreement and activity your association might be considered as affilited to this particular church.
  
  **Note:** Your members individual views are not taken into account, what matters is the position of the association as a whole.

  For example: The objective of your association is to organise conferences during a specific space mission. In this case you could have an expected end date.  
  Keep in mind that another option is to end the association once it ceases to serve its purpose.
