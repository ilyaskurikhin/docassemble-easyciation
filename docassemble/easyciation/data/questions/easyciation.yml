  ####The creation of a Swiss association 
  
  ######Creating a Swiss association is really easy.  
  
  * ######How many people do I need to create an association?
  An association can legally be established by the will of two or more members.
  It acquires legal personality as soon as their intention to exist as a legal entity is expressed in its Articles of Association.
  
  * ######Do I need to finance the association?
  No minimal capital is required to create an association.
  
  * ######What is exactly an association?
  Upon its constitution, an association becomes an autonomous legal entity, with its own rights and obligations.
  
  #####What steps should I follow in order to create my association in Switzerland?
  
  * At least two founding members must hold a constitutive assembly
  
  * ######FIRST - Articles of association
  Adopt the Articles of Association which include the purpose of the organisation. This is what we will do today!
  
  * ######SECOND - Appointment of members
  Appoint the members of the mandatory bodies of the organisation. General assembly + the Board
  
  * ######THIRD - Seat and purpose
  Determine the registered office (the seat) of the association. 
  As stated in Article 60 of the Swiss Civil Code, the purpose of an association may be“political, religious, scientific, artistic, charitable, social or any other non-economic purpose”. This will also be covered in the draft of the articles of association that we will help you create today.
